# Microservices Kubernetes Deployment
This project demonstrates a microservices-based architecture application deployed on Kubernetes using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Overview
The application is hosted on AWS's Kubernetes service (EKS) and is accessible via the subdomain socks.kingdavid.me, secured with HTTPS. Prometheus and Grafana are utilized for logging and monitoring purposes. Each component of the application runs in its own Docker container, following a microservices architecture, which enhances the efficiency and scalability of the application.

## Deployment Steps
The deployment process is automated through two bash scripts:

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup and Application Deployment
Execute the first script [auto-deploy-1.sh](auto-deploy-1.sh). This script performs the following tasks:

- Creates all necessary AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
- Deploys the application components.
- Installs essential tools such as Ingress Controller, Certificate Manager, Prometheus, and Grafana.
### Step 2: DNS Configuration
After the initial deployment, log in to your AWS Management Console:

- Create an A record for your subdomain socks.kingdavid.me using the Classic Elastic Load Balancer endpoint generated by the first script.
- This will enable HTTP access to your deployment, although it will not yet be secured with HTTPS.
### Step 3: Enabling HTTPS
To secure your deployment with HTTPS, execute the second script [auto-deploy-2.sh](auto-deploy-2.sh). This script finalizes the setup by:

- Configuring HTTPS for your deployment, ensuring secure access to your application.
